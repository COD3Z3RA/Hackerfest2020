Given a binary string  of length , you can cyclically shift this string any number of times. For example, consecutively applying cyclic shift operation to the binary string "" you will get "", "" and so on.

Let  be the decimal representation of string . Find the greatest power of  with which  can be divisible with, if it can be divisible with arbitrarily large power print "".

For the result, you are required to print a single integer denoting the maximum power of  by which  can be divisible with.

For example if string "", we can cyclically shift  time to get string "" which in decimal is  and is divisible with , hence the answer is .
